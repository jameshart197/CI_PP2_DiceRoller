## Design

### Colour

For the colour scheme I chose to go with black, white and purple as it matches the duck pond logo and theme. Important information is displayed in red. I also feel that these colours provide a professional looking site that is easy to read. When clear contrast was needed, I used blue and cyan to stand out easily from the page. 


<details><summary> Colour Palette</summary> <img src="docs/adobecolor.png"></details>

### Fonts

I used the sans-serif throughout the site as I feel that it is incredibly clear and something that many users will be used to. I do not feel that the font was particularly important in terms of style as much as it was important that the information was clear to read. 


### Structure

The site is structured in a manner that is at once both clear to understand and intuitive for the user to navigate. This was achieved by clear indicators on various elements, a clean interface with very little clutter and simple colours. All external links open in a new tab and are recognizable as links by use of the FontAwesome icons for those sites. 
The site is only a single page, intended to be added to a larger website in the future.


### Wireframes

Unfortunately during the course of this project the Wireframe files were lost. Due to time constraints I have chosen not to recreate them after the project was finished just for the sake of including them in the Readme. The wireframes were made with Balsamiq and the key difference between them and the final project was in the mobile wireframes I initially did not have an "action panel" in the bottom of the screen because I had not considered that you cannot right click on mobile/tablet. When I realised this, I needed to make adjustments to the site, and created an action panel with modifying buttons.

## Testing

### Accessibility

The WAVE WebAIM web accessibility evaluation tool was used to ensure the website met high accessibility standards. A warning is provided for an unlabelled form element, despite the presence of a label on the modifiers-desktop container. I was unable to rectify this error in the time available. There is also a contrast issue raised with the Roll button and its relevant text but I felt that the purpose of the button was clear even if the text was not present and thus chose to maintain the style. 

<details><summary>Wave Evaluation Summary</summary>
<img src="docs/validation/wave.png">
</details>

### Performance

Google Lighthouse in Google Chrome Developer Tools was used to test the performance of the website. The site is a little below the expected standard on mobile due to the presence of many images, some of which are not optimized for mobile. I chose to keep the images as they are at the cost of a small performance hit on mobile. The same warning that was present on the WAVE test is present for the Lighthouse test and remains unresolved (unlabelled form element).

| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Incremental Counter was going below 0  | Created ‘if’ statement for if the number is NOT 0 to execute the code. |
| Right Clicking the image was bringing up a context-menu | Found solution through stackoverflow for preventing default on right click within an HTML element |
| User cannot right click in mobile format | Implemented up and down buttons in the user-action-panel for mobile |                                                               |
| Clear button was being overwritten by text | Set a top margin in the results-box area. |
| Numbers were not adding correctly, but instead concatenating the strings produced | Coerced all numbers rolled to be viewed as numbers as opposed to strings |
