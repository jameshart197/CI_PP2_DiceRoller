## Design

### Colour

For the colour scheme I chose to go with black, white and purple as it matches the duck pond logo and theme. Important information is displayed in red. I also feel that these colours provide a professional looking site that is easy to read. When clear contrast was needed, I used blue and cyan to stand out easily from the page. 


<details><summary> Colour Palette</summary> <img src="docs/adobecolor.png"></details>

### Fonts

I used the sans-serif throughout the site as I feel that it is incredibly clear and something that many users will be used to. I do not feel that the font was particularly important in terms of style as much as it was important that the information was clear to read. 


### Structure

The site is structured in a manner that is at once both clear to understand and intuitive for the user to navigate. This was achieved by clear indicators on various elements, a clean interface with very little clutter and simple colours. All external links open in a new tab and are recognizable as links by use of the FontAwesome icons for those sites. 
The site is only a single page, intended to be added to a larger website in the future.
